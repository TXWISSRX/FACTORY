# FACTORY

Our automated system, in the medical field, is designed to fill and cap bottles with a medical syrup, as well as to label packages and bottles.


## Programs
* TIAPORTAL V17
* FACTORY IO
* PLCSIM



## GUIDE

To run the simulation, follow these steps:

* Open the TiaPortalV17 program on your computer.
* Once the program is launched, locate and run the simulation. The PLCSim will start automatically, simulating the behavior of the programmable logic controller.
* Next, open the Factory IO software. This application provides a virtual environment for simulating industrial processes and equipment.
* Within Factory IO, you will find an interface known as the IHM (Interface Homme Machine) or Human-Machine Interface. Open the IHM to gain control over the simulated factory and its components.
* From the IHM, you can send commands and instructions to control various aspects of the factory's operations, such as activating/deactivating machinery, adjusting settings, or initiating processes.
#### By following these steps, you will be able to run the simulation and utilize the IHM to command and interact with the virtual factory environment.
